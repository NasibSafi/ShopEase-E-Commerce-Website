## 




### redis Implementation of shopping cart function

1. When do I add a shopping cart record?
    - Shopping cart records are added when users click Add to Cart
2. When do I need to retrieve cart records?
   - You need to get the cart records when you use the data in the shopping cart and the shopping cart page.
3. What is the format for analyzing the cart records?
   - A user's shopping cart record is stored in one data
   - `hash` card_user_id : { sku_id1:number of items,sku_id2:number of items }
   - `"cart_1":{"1":3, "2":5}` => cart records added by a user with id 1: 3 items added by item id 1, 5 items added by item id 2
   - Get the number of items in the user's shopping cart: `HLEN`




### redis Save user browsing history
1. When do I need to add history?  
    *When you visit the product details page (in the view corresponding to the product details), you need to add the history of your browsing history*.
2. When do I need to get the browsing history?
   *When accessing the user's personal information.
3. What is the format for storing history in redis?
   
   Each user's browsing history is stored as one piece of data, using the List type *
   user id:[product id,...]
   When adding a history, the id of the latest product viewed by the user is inserted from the left side of the list


## 



- django Built-in functions to send emails
    ```python
    from django.core.mail import send_mail
    
    send_mail('send_header','send_body','sender','recipient_list',html_message='send_body(HTML format)')
    ```

    ```python
    # settings.py Configuration for sending emails
    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend' 
    EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.qq.com' # smtp service address
    EMAIL_PORT = 587 # smtp service port
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'xxx@qq.com' # sender email
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = '' # authorization code
    ```

- celery asynchronous tasks

    - Suitable for asynchronous processing problems, when sending emails, or uploading files, image processing and some other time-consuming operations, we can execute them asynchronously, so that users do not need to wait for a long time

    - Simple, easy to use and maintain, with rich documentation; efficient, a single celery process can handle millions of tasks per minute; flexible, almost every part of celery can be custom extended

    - Start celery: 

      celery -A celery_tasks.tasks worker --loglevel=info -P eventlet -c 10

    


- Login Decorator  [login_required](https://docs.djangoproject.com/zh-hans/4.0/topics/auth/default/#the-login-required-decorator)

- `request.user` Any request over, request will generate user information user, if not logged in is an instance of the `AnonymousUser` class; if logged in is an instance of the `AUTH_USER_MODEL` class, can be distinguished by `is_authenticated`

    

```python
# Defining the model abstract base class
from django.db import models
class BaseModel(models.Model):
    create_time = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True,verbose_name='Creation time')
    update_time = models.DateTimeField(auto_add=True,verbose_name='Update time')
    is_del = models.BooleanField(default=False,verbose_name='is_del')

    class Meta:
        abstract = True
```

### Concurrency problem (pessimistic lock, optimistic lock) 

If there is only one item in stock and more than one person places an order for that item at the same time, there may be a problem that the item has been purchased by one person, but the number of items in stock still exists when other people place orders, which is a concurrency problem

- Solved by pessimistic locking: the first time the data of the product is queried, a lock is added until the end of the transaction, the lock is released, and the purchase is successful or failed, otherwise, other people will be waiting for the order.
- Solved by optimistic locking: everyone buys the item at the same time, and when placing an order to change the inventory, determine whether the inventory is the same as the original inventory queried, if it is, the purchase is considered successful, otherwise the inventory has changed and multiple attempts are needed; the process of placing an order will not be blocked waiting
- Use optimistic locks when there are fewer conflicts

#### Pessimistic lock (locking when querying access data)

Lock is added when querying data until the transaction ends and the lock is released, otherwise all other sql statements are blocked

- SQL ： `select * from f_goods_sku where id=17 for update` (for update locking), the transaction ends and the lock is released
- Django ： `GoodsSKU.objects.select_for_update().get(id=17)`

#### Optimistic lock (judge whether the data is consistent when updating data)

No lock is added when querying the data, and a judgment is made when updating the data to determine whether the inventory at the time of update is the same as the inventory previously checked out.

**Assuming that the stock inventory queried is 1**

- SQL ： `update f_goods_sku set stock=0,sales=1 where id=17 and stock=1` (Set inventory-1 and determine whether the inventory is equal to the queried inventory1)
- Django
    ```python
    sku = GoodsSKU.objects.get(id=17)
    origin_stock = sku.stock 
    new_stock = origin_stock - int(count) # new_stock = the number of stocks found - the number to buy
    new_sales = sku.sales + int(count) # new_sales
    # update() returns the number of affected rows
    res = GoodsSKU.objects.filter(id=17,stock=origin_stock).update(stock=new_stock,sales=new_sales)
    if res == 0.
        """The update method returns 0 only proves that the data has been changed, and does not indicate that the current product is out of stock, so you need to try multiple times to query & update """
        transaction.savepoint_rollback(save_id) # Transaction rollback
        return "failed"
    ```
    - Need to set the isolation level of mysql transaction (read commits)
        
        - mysql configuration file add or modify: `transaction-isolation = READ-COMMITTED`
        - After django 2.x it seems that the transaction isolation level has been changed to READ-COMMITTED


### Page Static (Index)
1. generate static files asynchronously via celery
2. if the celery service and django service is not on the same machine, through the configuration of nginx access to the static file
3. send a command through celery to regenerate the index static page when the backend admin updates the home page data table
   - `ModelAdmin` method [admin admin site](https://docs.djangoproject.com/zh-hans/4.0/ref/contrib/admin/#modeladmin-methods)
     - `save_model()` method: called when the backend admin adds or updates the data in the table
     - `delete_model()` method: called when the backend admin deletes the data in the table

### Caching of page data
[CACHES](https://docs.djangoproject.com/zh-hans/4.0/topics/cache/)
CACHES configuration items in **settings.py**

1. set cache (Memcached, Redis, database cache, file system cache, local memory cache)
2. Cache method
   - Site cache (cache the whole site)
   - View caching (cache view results)
   - Template fragment caching (cache fragment content)
   - Underlying caching API (cache any Python object that can be safely pickedle)
3. When the backend administration modifies the home page information data, it needs to update the home page cache data

```python
from django.core.cache import cache

cache.set('my_key', 'hello, world!', 30)
cache.get('my_key')
cache.delete('my_key')
```
